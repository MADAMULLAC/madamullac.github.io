  <p class="lead">Our first game has been built from the ground up; using c++, OpenGL and several maths libraries, we intend to create a Game About Heuristic Mazes (GAHM). 'What does this mean?'... what this means is a very basic cube game, where you play as a simple cube trying to find your way through a maze and avoid the onslaught of enemies heading your way.</p>
